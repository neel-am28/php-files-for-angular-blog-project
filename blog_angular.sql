While the network at one time had five prequel series in the early stages of development, only one has officially moved forward into production. Greenlit in 2018, this as-yet-unnamed series is helmed by showrunner Jane Goldman, and the pilot has been&nbsp;filmed in Belfast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with its parent series, much of the information about this spinoff is shrouded in secrecy, and a premiere date is still nowhere in sight. However, there have been a few clues dropped by author George R.R. Martin and HBO execs about what the series might include, and what it probably won&#39;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below, we&#39;ve scraped together every vague prediction, plot hint, and educated guess we&#39;ve been able to get our hands on about the Game of Thrones prequel, in an attempt to get a clearer picture of what to expect when the highly anticipated series eventually makes its way onto our television screens.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Long, long ago...</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/got_2.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reports about the timeline for Bloodmoon have been conflicting, but the one thing everyone seems to agree on is that this is no mere decades-earlier prequel. HBO said in their brief summary that the show will take place &quot;thousands of years&quot; before the events of Game of Thrones, beginning toward the end of the Age of Heroes and journeying through the events that led to Westeros&#39; &quot;darkest hour,&quot; which will presumably be the Long Night, brought on by the first appearance of the White Walkers. Martin threw out the figure of 10,000 years on his website, with the caveat that it may actually be only half that, depending on whether the better historians are the oral histories of the First Men or the maesters at the Citadel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether Bloodmoon takes place five or ten thousand years before the start of Game of Thrones, we can expect this version of Westeros to look very different from the one we&#39;ve come to know. Central holdings like Winterfell and the Red Keep won&#39;t be constructed, and the massive, magical Wall that divides the North from the Lands of Always Winter won&#39;t yet have any reason to exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>No familiar faces</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/got_3.jpg\" style=\"height:438px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering how far in the past this series is thought to take place, don&#39;t expect to see any familiar faces pop up on your screen. While the cast of Bloodmoon may still be populated with Starks, Lannisters, and Boltons, they won&#39;t be the ones we&#39;ve come to know and love &mdash; or hate &mdash; over the eight seasons of Game of Thrones. Even most of the characters who have only appeared in flashbacks in the flagship series won&#39;t be born until thousands of years after the prequel takes place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single exception to this could be the Night King, whose creation we caught glimpses of in Game of Thrones, and who is thought to be thousands of years old. HBO has promised that the prequel will reveal the &quot;true origin of the White Walkers,&quot; which means that not only could the Night King show up, but we may finally learn who he was before he became an immortal ice being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 1, 'Sep,18,2019 06:35:20 PM', 'Mario Speedwagon.'),

In 2015, Krypton refugee Kara Zor-El &mdash; aka Kara Danvers &mdash; threw aside her glasses and donned her family&#39;s S-shaped crest to follow in her cousin&#39;s footsteps and give National City its very own superhero on the CW&#39;s Supergirl. Back then, Melissa Benoist&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;the actress playing both Supergirl the superpowered alien and Kara the shy personal assistant&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;was best known to TV fans for her role as sweet newcomer Marley Rose on two seasons of Glee, and she also had a small role in Best Picture-nominated&nbsp;Whiplash.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking the lead of a show &mdash; especially one with such a strong legacy on-screen and off &mdash; was a big step up for Benoist, both performance-wise and also physically. So how did she get ripped for the role? Well, Benoist said that landing the part&nbsp;meant stepping up her workouts, not just because we tend to take our superheroes with six-pack abs and toned biceps, but so that she could keep up with the action. The self-described pacifist and musical theater nerd suddenly found herself learning how to throw a punch and how to fly. So here&#39;s&nbsp;how Melissa Benoist toughened up to play&nbsp;Supergirl,&nbsp;at the gym, in her fight scenes and high up on the wires.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>She made it through a full-on audition process</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/super_girl_2.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously the CW couldn&#39;t cast just anyone as Supergirl, which meant that Melissa Benoist had to go through a rigorous audition process before she got anywhere close to landing the role. The wait was made even more excruciating because, according to Benoist, &quot;I believe I was the first girl they saw.&quot; That first audition was in October 2014, and it was just the start. In 2015, she told Entertainment Weekly, &quot;It was a long, drawn-out, three-month process. I auditioned around Halloween 2014 and then didn&#39;t land the part until February 2015. I went through multiple screen-tests, multiple auditions with the producing team. There was a lot.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During that extensive audition process, Variety reported that Benoist found a champion in producer Greg Berlanti. &quot;Greg championed me the whole time and was in my corner,&quot; Benoist remembered. &quot;Even when I didn&#39;t think the part was mine, he was always rooting for me. That support goes a long way, especially when I&#39;m fighting for something I want so badly. His belief in me really touched me.&quot; Berlanti echoed the sentiment, saying, &quot;If we had not found her, I would have said, &#39;I don&#39;t want to make this.&#39;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first episode aired almost a year after that first audition, on October 26, 2015, and since then, Benoist has seen hundreds of kids in their own versions of her costume. &quot;Every Halloween there is quite a bit of Supergirls,&quot; she told Jimmy Kimmel, so it was worth the wait.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Melissa Benoist worked on her core strength</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/super_girl_3.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While comic book titans DC and Marvel have both made noise about introducing more diversity to their products, one thing that all superheroes have in common are incredible abs. Benoist&#39;s Supergirl is no exception. She told Entertainment Weekly that to prepare for the role, she did &quot;some boxing, strength training, and a lot of core work.&quot; At Comic-Con, she said that her workouts included Pilates, boxing, and plyometrics.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&#39;ve never had cause to get into superhero shape, you might be wondering what fresh hell plyometrics are. As Healthine explains, plyometrics involve exerting your body to its maximum ability for a short period of time&nbsp;&mdash; for example, by jumping&nbsp;&mdash; to improve strength, speed, and power. They&#39;re a pretty advanced form of exercise, as Benoist found out! On CBS&#39;s This Morning, she explained,&nbsp;&quot;I did quite a bit of training. We did this stuff called plyometrics, which is like jump training. And all of it was really hard &mdash; just hard things!&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the core work isn&#39;t just to look good. As Benoist added, the core work comes in handy when you&#39;re doing the flying stunts. &quot;I&#39;m up on a wire,&quot; she said, &quot;and&nbsp;you have to hold your entire bodyweight so there&#39;s a lot of training involved.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>She does (some of) her own stunts on Supergirl</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/super_girl_4.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Believe it or not, it really is Benoist doing some of those hair-raising stunts on the show. The actress told Variety that she likes to get involved with the action when she can, saying, &quot;I have been doing a lot [of stunts], and I want to keep doing them. Already I&#39;ve fought a male on the show. Supergirl&#39;s fight moves are boxing. She&#39;s really heavy-handed. There&#39;s some flying that involves kicking and punching mid-flight that&#39;s kind of awesome.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, not everyone was thrilled with Benoist&#39;s hands-on approach to fights. Her mom, Julie,&nbsp;told her that she found it difficult to watch her daughter&#39;s fight scenes, especially against men. But&nbsp;Julie Benoist needn&#39;t have worried. Benoist knows her limits, and she&#39;s heaped praise on her stunt doubles. In 2015,&nbsp;she said of stunts,&nbsp;&quot;I think they&#39;re so fun. There are some that I just can&#39;t &mdash; I really could get injured. &hellip; My stunt double is amazing. She was Jen Garner&#39;s on Alias and Buffy&#39;s. She&#39;s all over the place, and she&#39;s so cool. I wish people could see what they go through. It&#39;s insane.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benoist&#39;s stunt double in 2015 was&nbsp;Shauna Duggins, whose resume includes Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the recent Star Trek movies, and 2000&#39;s Charlie&#39;s Angels (as well as many other movies and shows.) After doing 20 episodes of Supergirl, Duggins went on to work as stunt coordinator for shows including Ray Donovan, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,&nbsp;and GLOW. She&#39;s a real-life superwoman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How Melissa Benoist got ripped for Supergirl</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BY&nbsp;NATASHA LAVENDER<br />\r\nShe&#39;s not a bird or a plane, and she&#39;s definitely not Superman!

Chyler Leigh, who plays Kara&#39;s adoptive sister Alex, said that the actors work really hard with the stunt coordinators to get the fight scenes just right. And those action-packed days are full-on workouts in their own right. &quot;When we do fight scenes, we&#39;re working out for six hours, just doing the same thing,&quot; she told CBS. &quot;We are burnt for the next few days. I think that&#39;s really where I get my caloric burn count.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even when they aren&#39;t shooting, Leigh and Benoist try to use those periods of waiting around that happen on the set of a TV show to stay in shape. &quot;Melissa and I try to do as much as we possibly can,&quot; Leigh said. &quot;In my trailer, I&#39;ve got resistance bands and medicine balls and things like that. I try to do it in between, but we have very little downtime.&quot; The two on-screen sisters also have a shared interest in the same workout. &quot;I love Pilates,&quot; Leigh told CBS. &quot;It gives such a good core foundation. When I can go, it&#39;s awesome.&quot; And you thought TV sets were all craft services and hanging out in trailers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Melissa Benoist learned to fight from the best<br />\r\nThos Robinson/Getty Images<br />\r\nAnother crucial element of being a superhero is being able to kick butt convincingly. This didn&#39;t come naturally to Benoist, who confessed to the Chicago Tribune, &quot;I had never punched anyone! I maybe slapped my sisters when I was a kid, but I&#39;m not an aggressive, violent person, and I had no idea how to throw a punch.&quot; To help her find her inner fighter, Benoist took up boxing. &quot;I definitely had to learn technique. Like how to actually punch someone and not hurt yourself more than you&#39;re hurting the person you&#39;re punching. And so boxing was part of it,&quot; she told InStyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately for Benoist, she had access to excellent tutors. In addition to the stunt team, former karate and kickboxing world champion Lexi Alexander&nbsp;(pictured above) directed an episode in the first season. Having worked on Supergirl&#39;s fellow Arrowverse show Arrow, Alexander said she was excited to work on a story about a female superhero. &quot;I realized that this is the first time I&#39;m choreographing and directing a fight scene for a female lead. I did some fight directing for a woman here and there &hellip; but for a female lead? I&#39;ve never directed a female lead in an action,&quot; she told Den of Geek.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her directing stint was short, but Alexander said that she pushed her star &quot;to the next level of fight choreography,&quot; and that &quot;they&#39;ve now changed [Benoist&#39;s] fight style from [Alexander&#39;s] episode onward.&quot; Benoist might still be more lover than fighter at heart, but we wouldn&#39;t challenge her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She does (some of) her own stunts on Supergirl</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Believe it or not, it really is Benoist doing some of those hair-raising stunts on the show. The actress told Variety that she likes to get involved with the action when she can, saying, &quot;I have been doing a lot [of stunts], and I want to keep doing them. Already I&#39;ve fought a male on the show. Supergirl&#39;s fight moves are boxing. She&#39;s really heavy-handed.

After doing 20 episodes of Supergirl, Duggins went on to work as stunt coordinator for shows including Ray Donovan, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,&nbsp;and GLOW. She&#39;s a real-life superwoman.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>She likes to get out of the gym</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/super_girl_5.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Benoist diligently puts in her hours in the gym, the Colorado-raised actress is happier getting her exercise in the great outdoors. Her Instagram shows photos of her hiking with her husband (and Supergirl co-star), Chris Wood, and their dogs, Farley and Drift. She also recalled being jealous when she found out what her co-star and Supergirl predecessor, Helen Slater, was doing to get in shape.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Benoist recounted the boxing and core work she was doing to Slater, &quot;She gave me this look, and I was like, &#39;Why, what did they have you do?&#39;&quot; Benoist told Entertainment Weekly. &quot;&#39;Oh, I went horseback riding, and fencing and doing some archery, and I was swimming.&#39; She went through this whole gamut of awesome outdoor activities that I would love to do to train.&quot; Speaking to E! Online, Benoist said of Slater&#39;s exercise regime, &quot;She was on trampolines a lot and dancing and prancing and doing all these cool activities for training. I wish I had that much fun.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conflicting training schedules aren&#39;t coming between the two actresses. Benoist added to EW, &quot;Also, she&#39;s just so kind and such a sweet, sweet woman. That&#39;s really what I&#39;ve learned from her. She really is a supergirl. I&#39;m so honored that I&#39;m following in her footsteps.&quot; She&#39;ll just have to wait for a filming break to take a hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 1, 'Sep,16,2019 07:03:00 PM', 'Petey Cruiser.'),

Almost every aspect of the show is laden with Easter egg-style detailing&mdash;showrunners the Duffer brothers assembled the show as an ode to their decade of birth, and the history of its creation is almost as fascinating as the series itself. Here&#39;s a look at the behind-the-scenes story of Stranger Things.&nbsp;</p> \r\n\r\n<h1>Other series&#39; fans might notice a familiar setting</h1> \r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/stranger_2.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>During the battle at Starcourt Mall during Stranger Things season 3, Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) was forced to use every bit of power she had within her to pull a piece of the Mind Flayer from her leg. The incident left her powerless, and at the very end of the season 3 finale, Eleven is still without her psychokinetic abilities. But Stranger Things wouldn\'t be Stranger Things without its fully-functional superhero, so before the series bows out, you can bet Eleven will get back to normal.  According to one fan theory on Reddit, Eleven may actually be possessed by the Mind Flayer — evidenced by the similarities between her leg wound and Billy\'s (Dacre Montgomery) arm earlier in the season, as well as the appearance of a Mind Flayer-like shadow in her final scene. If the rest of the group has to fight a possessed Eleven on upcoming seasons of Stranger Things, it might be a good thing that she\'s currently powered-down.</p> \r\n\r\n<h1>The show&#39;s music was pitched with a major movie splice</h1> \r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/stranger_3.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" />\r\n\r\n<p>Finding the right child stars for Stranger Things was of paramount importance to the show&#39;s potential success because even though there are cast members with higher billing, a lot of the action and intensity revolves around the little scamps. To find the right stars, the Duffer brothers auditioned 906 boys and 307 girls for the roles using scenes from Stand By Me, the 30-year-old Stephen King-based classic that had a ton of influence on their own story.</p>  <p>When they finally settled on Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McClaughlin, and Noah Schnapp, they were pleased by the immediate camaraderie the boys had with one another (they&#39;d even formed a group text during the summer leading up to production, which made them fast friends before filming began). Settling on Millie Bobby Brown as their Eleven, too, was a moment of win.

The onetime DVD delivery service began streaming its library online in 2007, and that year, it notched 7.48 million subscribers.&nbsp;That number steadily climbed every year, and in 2013, the streamer truly started deploying what have become the most potent weapons in its subscriber base-building arsenal: its vaunted originals.&nbsp;House of Cards and&nbsp;Orange Is the New Black both debuted that year, and since then, the number of households with a Netflix account has increased exponentially, reaching 139 million in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in 2019, something troubling happened: the service actually lost domestic subscribers for the first time in eight years and missed its global projections by nearly half, causing its stock to tumble and competitors &mdash; both existing and on the horizon &mdash; to smell blood in the water. While it may seem a little early to ring the streamer&#39;s death knell, the stumble can be looked at as part of a trend&hellip; one that suggests that in the years to come, Netflix could be facing some seriously rough terrain in its bid to remain the premier streaming service. Signs are pointing to the possibility that Netflix could be in big trouble &mdash; and here&#39;s why.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Turn down the volume</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/netflix_2.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Netflix will spend $15 billion on original content in 2019, a budget which has steadily increased year after year. But in contrast to years past, the streamer&#39;s efforts to field something for everyone is beginning to simply lead to an increasingly crowded and confusing field of originals. This crowding can be a bane to some of Netflix&#39;s offerings, as its much-maligned algorithm can often fail to suggest shows that might interest certain viewers, at least partially owing to the glut of material available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company has publicly acknowledged that its original offerings aren&#39;t driving growth like they used to, despite the ever-increasing spending &mdash; and there doesn&#39;t seem to be a clear solution to the problem. Of course, the streamer can always fall back on its enormous library of licensed content, which (believe it or not) actually accounts for the vast majority of Netflix&#39;s domestic viewing hours. But as more production houses and rival services are entering the streaming fray, even those with which Netflix has enjoyed long, mutually beneficial relationships are beginning to eye the possibility of cutting ties in favor of taking their product directly to the consumer on their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>License revoked</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/netflix_3.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, Netflix has little choice but to continue relying on its originals to satisfy subscribers, because its catalog of licensed content is shriveling &mdash; and it&#39;ll continue to do so.&nbsp;Studios once eager to use Netflix as the online home for their brands are now bent on getting their own piece of the streaming pie, a situation which has resulted in some of Netflix&#39;s most reliable licensed offerings &mdash; notably&nbsp;Friends, which will depart for HBO Max in 2020,&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Office, which will find a permanent home on NBC&#39;s upcoming service &mdash; finding their days on Netflix numbered.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously, such developments are bound to give serious pause to consumers whose main interest is in the big studio-produced content which has been Netflix&#39;s bread and butter over the years. It may seem like we hear of a new streamer getting set to launch every month or so, but many of these could end up catering to niche markets of consumers who are simply exhausted with all of the comings and goings of their favorite shows inherent to Netflix. For that matter, some of Netflix&#39;s competition have quietly begun to beat the streamer at its own favorite game: fielding quality, must-see originals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 1, 'Sep,16,2019 07:04:00 PM', 'Anna Sthesia.'),

While it still used the narrative trick of flipping between the past and present, the focus shifted from suicide to survival &mdash; and all the complications that can come with that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In season three, there&#39;s a new girl at Liberty High, Ani Achola (Grace Saif), whose mother Josephine Amara (Nana Mensah) is a home care worker for Nora Walker&#39;s (Brenda Strong) ailing father. Serial rapist Bryce Walker (Justin Prentice), fresh off his acquittal for crimes everyone knew he committed, lives with his mother Nora after his father Barry (Jake Weber) moves in with his new girlfriend. Like Hannah Baker (Katherine Langford) before her, Ani is an unreliable narrator who is drawn to perpetual good guy Clay Jensen (Dylan Minnette) as well as his troubled group of friends. Ani is positioned as a simultaneous insider and outsider as the new girl, who uses her keen sense of perception to help Clay and his friends process a number of different traumas as well as figure out who killed Liberty High&#39;s most hated guy, Bryce Walker.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s a lot to unpack and untangle, but we&#39;re here to help. Here&#39;s the ending of&nbsp;13 Reasons Why&#39;s third season explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>What happens after the Spring Fling in 13 Reasons Why?</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/13rw_2.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Season two of 13 Reasons Why culminates in Montgomery &quot;Monty&quot; de la Cruz (Timothy Grenaderos) and his friends brutally raping Tyler Downs (Devin Druid) in the boys&#39; bathroom at school. Tyler is so physically and psychologically broken by the assault that he plans a school shooting to take revenge on the boys who hurt him, as well as other classmates who had bullied him. Clay stands in the line of fire and calms Tyler until Tony Padilla (Christian Navarro) shows up in a getaway car. In season three, we find out Tony disarmed Tyler and dumped the guns and suicide vest into the river. Tyler left behind a flash drive recounting what Monty did to him, as well as telling his parents he loved them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The police continue to believe that the call about the shooting was a hoax, but Clay and his friends remain on edge nine months later. Season three also reveals that Bryce saw the confrontation between Tyler and Clay, as well as Tony. For the nine months after Tyler&#39;s attempted shooting, Clay organizes his friends to actively support Tyler as he heals. During most of that time, almost no one knows about the assault; it&#39;s assumed that Tyler&#39;s motives were simply retribution for being bullied.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>13 Reasons Why and 1 terrible homecoming game</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/13rw_3.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bryce Walker leaves Liberty High and transfers to rival all-boys private school Hillcrest, where his reputation as a rapist follows him. As hated in his new school as he was in his old one, Bryce causes new destruction when one of his victims, Jessica (Alisha Boe), learns that he&#39;s not only being allowed to return to Liberty to play football as a member of the Hillcrest team during the homecoming game but that his mother wanted to re-enroll him there. Jess is now student body president, having run on a platform targeting jock culture, and she organizes a protest with her new survivor support group Hands Off Our Bodies. A group of women, led by Jess, disrupts the homecoming game by stripping and revealing blood-colored handprints on their bare flesh. When a Hillcrest player grabs Jess, she hits and kicks him, which sets off a chain of violence in retaliation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Bryce learns that his ex-girlfriend Chloe (Anne Winters) &mdash; who he also raped, and who lied in for him in season two of&nbsp;13 Reasons Why&nbsp;&mdash; was not only pregnant with his baby, she had an abortion without telling him. Because Bryce&#39;s ex-teammate Zach (Ross Butler) helped her, Bryce uses the fight as an excuse to rush Zach and snap his knee, effectively destroying Zach&#39;s future in sports.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>13 Reasons Why season 3 and the mystery of who killed Bryce Walker</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/13rw_4.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the homecoming fracas, Bryce Walker disappears &mdash; and then his body shows up floating in the river. Police initially thought he was shot; then they announce he was beaten to death. Finally, they reveal his death was by drowning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every single character is lying about where they were after homecoming &mdash; for many different reasons &mdash; on the night Bryce was killed, and almost every one of them has at least one good reason to kill him. 13 Reasons Why explores each person and each reason in depth. But because of Mrs. Walker, the police wrongly focus on Clay, who almost goes to jail. So who actually killed Bryce?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We find out that Zach follows him out to the pier and beats him badly in retaliation for busting his knee and destroying his future. Zach leaves him wounded and phoneless, and eventually confesses his role to the police in order to help Clay. But it&#39;s actually Alex (Miles Heizer) who throws Bryce into the river in retaliation for Bryce&#39;s verbal abuse of Jess. Ani helps create a narrative to pin the blame on Monty, who&#39;s already died in jail while awaiting his hearing for raping Tyler. Alex&#39;s dad, Deputy Standall (Mark Pellegrino), helps cover up Alex&#39;s involvement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a creepy nod to Hannah Baker, Bryce leaves behind a confession cassette tape including an apology &mdash; and admitting to raping at least nine women, some of them multiple times.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>13 Reasons Why season 3&#39;s depictions of healing from sexual assault</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/13rw_5.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Season three of 13 Reasons Why is dominated by survivors, and has a particular focus on those who&#39;ve survived sexual assault. Jessica no longer has to go to school with the guy who raped her, but she&#39;s still struggling. She realizes one way to reclaim herself is by becoming an advocate for other survivors, and she becomes an activist to end rape culture on campus. She uses her story to empower others to share theirs and begin healing. From her activism, she is also finally able to reclaim her own body and sexuality, and in the process realizes that she still has feelings for her ex Justin (Brandon Flynn), in spite of the fact it was his best friend who raped her.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tyler Downs is not so lucky. He has to see the person who assaulted him every day. Worse, Monty openly taunts him and even threatens to rape him again. Tyler is so traumatized he won&#39;t use the bathrooms in the school. Alex encourages him to take boxing lessons at Caleb&#39;s (RJ Brown) gym, which is his first step to self-reclamation &mdash; but not before considering suicide again and also threatening to kill Bryce, since Monty told him Bryce was the one who orchestrated the rape. Tyler finally tells Clay what happened, which ultimately opens Tyler&#39;s life to the path of healing. He ends up using photography and art as therapy he can share with others.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 1, 'Sep,16,2019 07:05:00 PM', 'Petey Cruiser.'),

Even a man of steel like Superman is vulnerable to things like Kryptonite, magic, or your occasional big, spiky dude. A lot of other superheroes suffer similar vulnerabilities. Green Lantern&#39;s powers were once useless against the color yellow. Martian Manhunter has more superpowers than most of the rest of the Justice League combined, but if you get him too close to a campfire, he&#39;ll freak.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But a hero&#39;s weakness isn&#39;t always physical. With a few notable exceptions, most members of the MCU&#39;s Avengers don&#39;t command the same kind of godlike powers as the Justice League&#39;s recruits, and their vulnerabilities tend to go deeper than skin. They&#39;re overconfident, they&#39;re weighed down by feelings of inadequacy, or in some cases, you just don&#39;t know whose side they&#39;re going to be on from one minute to the next. As much as the team can sometimes work like a well-oiled machine, a villain with the cunning of Loki or Ultron&nbsp;&mdash; who knows and can exploit those weaknesses&nbsp;&mdash; can break the team down.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t believe us? Well, consider the following as we look at the biggest weaknesses of every member of the Avengers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iron Man puts everything on his shoulders</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/avenger_2.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saying that someone&#39;s strength can also be their weakness is clich&eacute;, but it&#39;s clich&eacute; because it&#39;s true, and the MCU&#39;s Iron Man is a perfect example.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ever since the Battle of New York in 2012&#39;s&nbsp;The Avengers, Tony Stark has held the world on his shoulders. When the Chitauri came screaming out of the sky over Manhattan, everything changed for Tony. The knowledge that hostile alien forces were waiting out in the void was too much for him to process without doing something about it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While this sense of responsibility helps save the world multiple times, including in his final battle in 2019&#39;s&nbsp;Avengers: Endgame, it also feeds Stark&#39;s biggest failures. It justifies, in his mind, his deception in&nbsp;Avengers: Age of Ultron and leads to the creation of a sentient robot that almost destroys the world. It&#39;s also a big part of his motivation to back the Sokovia Accords in&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War, sending him on a collision course with Steve Rogers and leaving the world with a divided Avengers once Thanos comes calling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cap is too good for his own good</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/avenger_3.jpg\" style=\"height:437px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In U2&#39;s &quot;The Fly,&quot; Bono sings, &quot;It&#39;s no secret that a liar won&#39;t believe anyone else.&quot; That&#39;s because we tend to expect from the world what we expect from ourselves. If you lie all the time, then you probably assume&nbsp;everybody&nbsp;lies all the time, and so you trust no one. It works the other way, too. If you&#39;re a selfless and courageous&nbsp;patriot who always demands the best from yourself, then you&#39;re probably going to expect the best from everyone around you. And if you&#39;re Steve Rogers, you&#39;ll be disappointed. A lot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s this aspect of Steve that helps start so much trouble in&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War. Of course, he doesn&#39;t see a need for the Sokovia Accords &mdash; he expects the best from everyone around him. He fights so hard, risks so much, and&nbsp;loses&nbsp;so much to protect his old friend Bucky because, in spite of what he knows Bucky has done, he still expects the best from him. It&#39;s why the deceptions he endures from Black Widow and Nick Fury, who he&nbsp;knows&nbsp;are spies, somehow come as a surprise to him, and it&#39;s why he&#39;s able to join S.H.I.E.L.D. without noticing the growing threat of Hydra until Fury is dying on his living room floor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>The Hulk&#39;s weakness is that he&#39;s unpredictable</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/avenger_4.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing that&#39;s always been clear about the Hulk in the films and the comics is that his biggest weakness&nbsp;&mdash; at least in terms of working with a team&nbsp;&mdash; is that you&#39;re never really sure exactly&nbsp;which&nbsp;Hulk you&#39;re going to be dealing with, and if you get the wrong one, then he&#39;s just as likely to smash his teammates as he is to smash the real enemy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Loki is doubtlessly using his power and that of the Mind Stone to influence the Hulk when he goes wild on the Helicarrier in&nbsp;The Avengers, the Hulk isn&#39;t someone you have to work&nbsp;that hard to manipulate. While the moment is arguably one of the most hilarious of the film, the Hulk shows his willingness to lash out at allies when he sucker punches Thor in Grand Central Station. He&#39;s one of four Avengers who are assaulted in a single scene by Scarlet Witch&#39;s mental powers in&nbsp;Avengers: Age of Ultron, yet he&#39;s the only one who not only attacks one of his teammates because of it but goes on a rampage through Johannesburg. And in&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok, there are no witches or warlocks playing with his mind when he chooses to attack Thor in Sakaar&#39;s arena. Basically, &quot;the other guy&quot; is unpredictable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 4, 'Sep,16,2019 07:05:00 PM', 'Anna Sthesia.'),

Granted, over the past few years, DC has had a tough time when it comes to pleasing fans and critics.&nbsp;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was a disaster, Suicide Squad bombed, and the Justice League wasn&#39;t exactly the hit we had in mind. Fortunately, we can always count on&nbsp;Wonder Woman, and both Aquaman and Shazam! were big successes. And now, many believe that&nbsp;things are about to get better for fans of the DC film universe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cryptic trailers, announcements, and castings have sent the DC fandom into a veritable frenzy of theories, with everyone wondering what will happen next. What&#39;s going on with the Joker?&nbsp;Where&#39;s the Green Lantern? What will happen with Harley Quinn? Piecing together what&#39;s known from the comics and what little tidbits of info have slipped out, the internet has made some tenuous, tantalizing, exciting theories as to what&#39;s next for the DC cinematic universe. And trust us, if any of these DC film theories are true, they will change everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>The theory behind the two Jokers</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/dc_2.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Joker has become one of the world&#39;s best-known baddies. It&#39;s no wonder that DC is doing their best to get the most out of one of their most iconic characters, namely by producing not one but two Joker-centric films.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s Joker, the award-winning, R-rated take on a failed comedian becoming the grease-painted face of an anarchist movement, starring the scary-good Joaquin Phoenix. But then there&#39;s the controversial Joker from Suicide Squad&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;a slightly more modern, tatted-up version performed by Jared Leto. How are these two able to exist simultaneously in the same universe? Which is the real Joker? One popular theory claims that they&#39;re both Joker, with the Joker being more of an idea than a single person. Anyone could take up the mantle. When it comes to Jared Leto&#39;s Joker, some fans believe that he was at one time Jason Todd, one of Batman&#39;s own Robins, before he was brutalized and brainwashed by a previous Clown Prince of Crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This could explain the memorialized armor in the Batcave reading, &quot;Ha ha ha, joke&#39;s on you, Batman.&quot; Whatever his origin, whoever he once was, the Joker always seems to prove that what doesn&#39;t kill you makes you &hellip; stranger.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>DC could be getting darker than ever</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/dc_3.jpg\" style=\"height:438px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DC has always gotten something of a bad rap for making very gritty, dark movies with super grim plotlines. And&nbsp;Joker has fully embraced the lampooned edginess of DC, creating a film that goes where no superhero film has dared to go before. This formula appears to be successful, too. Joaquin Phoenix&#39;s performance has been praised left and right, and Joker&nbsp;has won all sorts of accolades and awards. In fact, rumor has it that Joker will be the first of DC&#39;s Dark or Black, a label given to movies that exist outside the DCEU as we know it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fans and directors on Twitter are theorizing that the next DC Dark film could be the Elseworlds storyline of Superman: Red Son. This alternate timeline imagines what would happen if Superman had landed in the Soviet Union rather than Kansas. Superman fighting for Stalin rather than the American Way turns the Cold War into a superhuman arms race, rather than a nuclear one. This isn&#39;t any less dangerous, as it turns out. Such a dark, politically charged plot seems tailor-made for a DC Dark label.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Will Shazam and Superman join forces against Black Adam?</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/dc_4.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson is, at last, squeezing his muscles into a spandex suit and appearing on the big screen as a superhero. As Black Adam, Johnson will be more villainous than heroic, standing against Shazam and his newly found family. As we learn in the&nbsp;Shazam! movie, Black Adam is the example of what happens when someone not so pure of heart is given wizard powers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Black Adam will be introduced in his own solo movie, but fans have been theorizing that the film will secretly be a team-up flick the likes of which DC has never attempted. See, Black Adam is so powerful that he can give even Superman trouble. Fans are saying that the Superman cameo at the end of Shazam! was featured as part of the build-up to the live-action version of the 2010 animated feature Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam. It will take the combined might of both Superman and Shazam to take down this champion-gone-bad.</p>\r\n', 4, 'Sep,16,2019 07:06:00 PM', 'Paul Molive.');

Still, since coming home to Marvel Studios, Tom Holland&#39;s portrayal of Peter Parker and his web-swinging alter-ego have proven to be the heart and soul of the narrative, making it that much more heartbreaking that negotiation breakdowns between Marvel and Sony ended with Spidey leaving Marvel Studios&#39; movies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which leaves us to wonder who, if anyone, could replace Spider-Man in the MCU. The hero holds a unique spot in Marvel&#39;s pantheon. He&#39;s a science whiz, but one without the resources of the late Tony Stark. He&#39;s not a soldier, a god, king, or a former assassin. Peter Parker is a young, wisecracking, imperfect hero who refuses to back down. He loses lots of fights, he makes lots of mistakes, and in many ways, he&#39;s the perfect Marvel everyman.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filling Spidey&#39;s webbed boots isn&#39;t going to be easy, but Marvel&#39;s got plenty of heroes waiting for their shot at the big screen and one of them just might be the answer to how the MCU could replace Spider-Man.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Ms. Marvel could step up to fill the void</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/mcu_2.jpg\" style=\"height:438px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kamala Khan, a.k.a.

She&#39;s a playable character in both the mobile&nbsp;Contest of Champions&nbsp;game and one of the most oft-used avatars in&nbsp;LEGO Marvel Super-Heroes 2. She&#39;s currently a regular star in&nbsp;three&nbsp;Marvel comic book titles.

First appearing in 2006&#39;s&nbsp;Amazing Fantasy&nbsp;#15, Cho is a genius whose mind works at the speed of a supercomputer, allowing him to achieve things that &mdash; from the outside &mdash; looks impossible. For example, when being pursued by a helicopter in his first appearance, Cho instantly calculates exactly how much to tilt the rearview mirror on his scooter to reflect a laser sight into the eye of the helicopter pilot &mdash; causing the pilot to swerve and the guy in the chopper firing a rocket at Cho to miss his target.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2015, Cho upped his hero game and became the Totally Awesome Hulk after absorbing the gamma radiation from Bruce Banner. He joined the Champions, where he remains a regular member, though he lost most of his gamma power and has since renamed himself, Brawn.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cho has the youth and the genius to replace Spider-Man, though he definitely doesn&#39;t suffer from an overabundance of humility. If he were around before Tony Stark died, he probably wouldn&#39;t be trying to just prove he could be an Avenger like Peter does for most of&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming. More likely, he&#39;d be trying to prove to Stark that he was smarter than the billionaire and that he should take over Stark&#39;s business.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Moon Knight could watch the streets</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/mcu_4.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moon Knight does not have the youthful optimism of Peter Parker. Nor, in many of his depictions, does he have a healthy degree of sanity.&nbsp;&nbsp;The vigilante&#39;s &quot;real&quot; name depends on which of his multiple personalities is dominant &mdash; mercenary Marc Spector, the rich Steven Grant, or taxi driver Jake Lockley. While his violence doesn&#39;t reach the level of the more murderous vigilantes like Punisher, he certainly isn&#39;t as forgiving as Spider-Man.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Moon Knight and Spider-Man do have the setting of New York City&#39;s streets in common. Like Spidey, Moon Knight isn&#39;t usually the kind of hero who blasts off into the stars or to other dimensions. Moon Knight usually sticks to the streets, though his adventures can often have a much more supernatural flavor than Spidey&#39;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also some nice coincidences that would make Moon Knight&#39;s replacement of Spider-Man a wonderful example of synchronicity. First, when Marvel Comics had their 2018&nbsp;Infinity Wars&nbsp;line-wide event which includes the creation of a universe where all the heroes are combinations of Marvel heroes &mdash; e.g. instead of Ghost Rider and Black Panther, the new universe has Ghost Panther &mdash; it was Moon Knight that Spider-Man fused with to create the Arachknight. More recently, there&#39;s the rumor that Marvel is looking to cast Andrew Garfield &mdash; who played Spider-Man in&nbsp;The Amazing Spider-Man&nbsp;and its sequel &mdash; to play Moon Knight. Given that there&#39;s a&nbsp;Moon Knight series on its way at Disney+, we should know more soon.</p>\r\n', 4, 'Sep,16,2019 07:07:00 PM', 'Paul Molive.'),

This character, of course, is Hugh Jackman&#39;s Logan, a.k.a. Wolverine, who&#39;s appeared in nine of the&nbsp;X-Men&nbsp;movies. Over the course of the franchise, Wolverine has lost and regained his memory, been sent back in time, and lived through multiple versions of the future. But unlike the other characters in the series, he&#39;s the only one whose consciousness has been consistent (or as consistent as these films get) throughout the whole thing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if you&#39;re confused, then read on, as we unravel the tangled events of the X-Men films and piece them back together in the order that Wolverine would&#39;ve experienced them, in the hopes that maybe, just maybe, they might make sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>1845: The story begins with James Howlett</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/volwerine_2.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first chronological glimpse we get of the boy who grows up to become Wolverine is in 2009&#39;s X-Men Origins: Wolverine, where we learn that his name isn&#39;t Logan at all. Instead, it&#39;s James Howlett. Logan is actually the surname of the man who murders James&#39; father, an event which causes James&#39; mutation to activate, pushing bone claws out from between his knuckles. Enraged, James kills Logan, only to learn that the man was actually his biological father.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with his half-brother, Victor Creed, young James flees his home. Victor possesses the same mutant healing ability as James, which not only makes the boys practically impossible to kill but also slows their aging, keeping them looking youthful for decade after decade. The two brothers spend the next century fighting side by side in a series of wars, including the Civil War, World War I, and World War II. In 2013&#39;s The Wolverine, we see that during this time, while being held in a Japanese POW camp in 1945, James saves the life of Japanese officer IchirÅ Yashida from the bombing of Nagasaki, an event which will prove important many years later.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>1962: That&#39;ll be a hard pass</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/volwerine_3.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In&nbsp;X-Men: First Class, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) find themselves up against Nazi mutant Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) and his team of superpowered henchman. Realizing they&#39;ll need some help to bring Shaw down, the duo uses Cerebro to find new mutants and a form a team of their own. So in a zippy montage set in 1962, they recruit Tempest (Zoe Kravitz), Darwin (Edi Gathegi), Havok (Lucas Till), and Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones), all with minimal persuasion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But their plan hits a solid roadblock when Erik and Charles walk into a bar and attempt to convince a cigar-smoking James to join their brand new squad of X-Men. No sooner have Erik and Charles introduced themselves than James (Hugh Jackman, in an uncredited cameo) tells them that he&#39;s uninterested in their offer. Only he doesn&#39;t put it quite so politely, using the film&#39;s one allotted PG-13 F-bomb to maximum, hilarious effect.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>The 1970s: Joining Team X</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"uploads/volwerine_4.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While fighting together in the Vietnam War, James notices Victor (Liev Schreiber) becoming increasingly more short-tempered and violent. Eventually, Victor sexually assaults a woman and then kills the officer who tries to intervene. James, not realizing what Victor has done, rushes to his brother&#39;s aid, and both are sentenced to die by firing squad. Of course, the mutants manage to survive the bullets thanks to their healing abilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their miraculous survival catches the eye of Major William Stryker (Danny Huston), as shown in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Victor and James are recruited to his black ops team of mutants, Team X. At this point, James starts going by the alias Logan, after the father he killed so many decades before. Logan and Victor work with Team X for several years, but ultimately, Logan decides he can no longer stomach the team&#39;s inhumane practices and callous disdain for human life. But while he quits Team X,&nbsp;Victor decides to stay, and the two-part ways.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>1979: Becoming the Wolverine</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/volwerine_5.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six years after walking away from Team X, Logan is pulled back into Stryker&#39;s world after Victor murders Logan&#39;s girlfriend. Stryker tells him Victor has gone rogue, and he asks Logan to undergo an experimental procedure that would fuse adamantium to his skeleton, making him strong enough to seek his revenge on Victor. The procedure would kill any other person, but with Logan&#39;s mutant healing ability, he should be able to survive. Logan agrees to join Stryker&#39;s program, which he calls Weapon X. Before undergoing the procedure, Logan requests new dog tags with the alias &quot;Wolverine.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The procedure is a success, but Stryker never intended to let Logan go free once it was completed. Stryker even orders that his memories be erased so he can use the Wolverine as a weapon. Logan manages to escape, but when he learns that Victor is kidnapping young mutants for Stryker, Logan returns to free them and to find Victor. The young mutants are flown to safety by Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), while Logan and Victor fight&nbsp;&mdash; first against each other, then together once more against Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds). However, once Wade is defeated, Logan tells Victor that they&#39;re done being brothers. Victor leaves, but before Logan can get out, Stryker shoots him in the head with an adamantium bullet. Logan survives, but when he regains consciousness, he realizes he has amnesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 4, 'Sep,16,2019 07:08:00 PM', 'Anna Mull.'),

Somehow, even without Killmonger, Kimoyo beads, and the heart-shaped herb, the Marvel Cinematic Universe films were lucrative, popular, and culture-defining.&nbsp;The Avengers&nbsp;from 2012 was a legit phenomenon, and the MCU&#39;s string of hits elevated previous obscure Marvel characters like Bucky Barnes and Black Widow into the mainstream. Then came Black Panther, and, for its most ardent fans, it split the MCU into two distinct halves: before T&#39;Challa, and after. The film was so successful and societally significant that it almost seems hard to imagine that there was a Marvel universe without Wakanda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Black Panther&#39;s impact can&#39;t just be measured in dollars and accolades. A couple of years after its debut, superhero fans the world over are starting to realize that this movie might&#39;ve changed the cinematic landscape forever. In ways large and small, we&#39;re seeing the ripples sent out from the chunk of Vibranium Ryan Coogler launched in the ocean that is the cape-and-cowl set &mdash; and they are, frankly, improving the genre by leaps and bounds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Women aren&#39;t just the love interests</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/black_panther_2.jpg\" style=\"height:438px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think back to Phase One of the MCU. Remember the great jokes, the impressive costume design, the heartfelt expressions of heroism. Now try to remember every female character from those movies you can. It&#39;s mostly the girlfriends, right? Pepper Potts, Peggy Carter, Jane Foster, plus some side characters like the irrepressible Darcy, Sif, Frigga, and, ultimately, the introduction of Black Widow. It&#39;s not the direst situation to be found in Hollywood, but generally speaking, if you&#39;re not there to smooch, you&#39;re either set dressing or the one very special lady Avenger who still spends a chunk of every movie playing the coquette to lure in her prey. Even Phase Two&#39;s introduction of Gamora in&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy fell into the same pattern, as she&#39;s relentlessly pursued by Peter Quill throughout the film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then came Black Panther&nbsp;in Phase Three and its cast full of women. There&#39;s Nakia, Shuri, Okoye, and the Dora Milaje, Queen Ramonda, and women filling out the royal cabinet. Women were everywhere in Black Panther, doing everything. Both within the MCU and outside of it, this was pretty revolutionary. While&nbsp;Captain Marvel&#39;s starring role in 2019 was in development for years,&nbsp;Black Panther&#39;s amazing cast of women may have gotten audiences ready to receive the film a year earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>It proved that audiences will cheer on characters from cultures beyond their own</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/black_panther_3.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBlockbuster movies don&#39;t typically bet on the unfamiliar. Some of this is a matter of commerce trumping creativity, some of it is writers, producers, and directors mirroring what they know, and some of it is simple disinterest. The machinery of movie-making as vast, complex, and profitable as the MCU tends to feature familiar actors, locations, and themes. Few productions want to be the first to try something new, especially if they&#39;ve got billions of dollars riding on their efforts. Fewer still make it all the way to a finished product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which makes Black Panther feel like kind of a miracle. It has a majority Black cast, takes place in a fictional African nation inspired by real African cultures, and features actors speaking Xhosa, an official language of Zimbabwe and South Africa. It is deeply rooted in specific places, histories, and aesthetics that most of the worldwide audience knows little about. And it made over $1 billion worldwide. Black Panther didn&#39;t just prove that people all over the world can embrace lives outside their own spheres of experience &mdash; it proved that they can fall in love with them, cheer them on, and come back for more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>It introduced new aesthetic influences</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/black_panther_4.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /><br />\r\nSuperhero movies tend to look the same. Save for a signature color or a formalwear scene, it&#39;s all based in ultramodern tech and military drab. This can be an interesting look, of course, but it does tend to blend together into a canvas of olive green, stainless steel, and dark suits. Thor shook this up admirably, and, with the release of the positively psychedelic Thor: Ragnarok, cemented its branch of the MCU as a risk-taker. For a while, you had three choices: you could be surrounded by SHIELD black, army base grey, or you could be in Asgard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing about all of these aesthetics, even Thor&#39;s, is that they&#39;re familiar. We know how action movies look, how Western, vaguely medieval-based fantasy looks, how military movies look. The MCU did them all well, but they&#39;d been done before.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then in strides Black Panther, with its wealth of color, texture, and fashion both ancient and contemporary. Audiences saw with the deep green of the River Tribe, the bright coral of the Dora Milaje, and Shuri&#39;s up-to-the-minute bomber jackets. Costume designer Ruth E. Carter, who won as Oscar for her work on Black Panther, managed to bring color, history, and an entirely unique aesthetic the majority of the audience was unfamiliar with. It&#39;s not just cohesive, it&#39;s not just new to the genre, it&#39;s not just rooted in an absolute avalanche of research &mdash; it&#39;s all of those things and more, packed into one movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>The bad guy can win the moral argument</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/black_panther_5.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /><br />\r\nKillmonger was an unscrupulous villain, willing to sacrifice anyone and everything to get what he wanted. He had no issue choking old women, murdering sages, and ruthlessly executing his girlfriend to achieve his aims. &quot;I trained, I lied, I killed just to get here &hellip; all this death, just so I could kill you,&quot; he tells T&#39;Challa as they face each other down. He knows exactly how cruel his actions are, and he accepts that as the price he must pay. When he finally dies, it&#39;s with the blood of hundreds on his hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in the midst of his assault upon Wakanda, he manages to actually win the moral argument the entire movie hinges on. He&#39;s animated by rage at Wakanda&#39;s inaction, and his anger is so potently acted and argued that T&#39;Challa ends up in the afterlife, confronting his dead dad with the points his enemy has made. In the end, T&#39;Challa defeats Killmonger &mdash; but he honors him with the last glimpse of the sunset and a version of his ideas incorporated into his royal agenda. Black Panther dared to show that the bad guy can be unquestionably bad, yet still have a valid point to make. In the end, in that sense, no one exactly lost or won. In the context of superhero movies, that ambiguity is daring indeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 4, 'Sep,16,2019 07:09:00 PM', 'Anna Mull.'),

It is, in a word, voluminous. In other word: awesome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A goodly number of the names dropped in Gunn&#39;s post had already been announced, including returning cast members Jai Courtney as Captain Boomerang and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, and new additions&nbsp;David Dastmalchian (Ant-Man and the Wasp) as Polka-Dot Man, Daniela Melchior as Ratcatcher, and Michael Rooker (Guardians of the Galaxy) as King Shark. Also previously announced were Nathan Fillion (Firefly), Flula Borg (The Good Place), John Cena (Bumblebee), Taika Waititi (Thor: Ragnarok), Peter Capaldi (Doctor Who), Storm Reid (A Wrinkle in Time), Steve Agee,&nbsp;and Idris Elba (Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw) in undisclosed roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The big takeaway from Gunn&#39;s post: after months upon months of rumors flying this way and that as to whether Margot Robbie would reprise the role of Harley Quinn from the first film, we can finally, definitively say that she will. It&#39;s been known for some time that Robbie will return to the role in next year&#39;s&nbsp;Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn), but up until today, whether or not she&#39;d be involved in The Suicide Squad was an open question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another welcome confirmation: Joel Kinnaman (The Killing, Robocop) is back on board as former spec ops specialist and team leader Rick Flag, a return which had previously been rumored and implied, but not confirmed. Joining the cast this time around are&nbsp;Alice Braga (I Am Legend),&nbsp;Joaqu&iacute;n Cos&iacute;o (Rambo: Last Blood), Mayling Ng (Wonder Woman), Juan Diego Botto, Saturday Night Live alum Pete Davidson, Tinashe Kajese (The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks), Julio Ruiz (Preacher), and Jennifer Holland (Brightburn).</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>All the Suicide Squad 2 rumors and spoilers leaked so far</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/suicide_squad_2.jpg\" style=\"height:438px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the critics had any say in the matter, the&nbsp;Suicide Squad&nbsp;film franchise would never see a second installment. Adapted from DC Comics&#39; series about supervillains strong-armed into working for the government,&nbsp;2016&#39;s&nbsp;Suicide Squad&nbsp;may have earned a horrible&nbsp;Rotten Tomatoes&nbsp;rating, but with a total gross approaching $750 million, it proved to be one of the DCEU&#39;s most successful films. So no matter how few stars critics gave the first one, we know a second one&#39;s coming.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s a lot we still don&#39;t know. We don&#39;t know exactly who will be in the film, or what character lineup to expect.&nbsp;Love it or hate it,&nbsp;Suicide Squad&nbsp;is conceptually unique in today&#39;s crowd of big-budget superhero flicks. Just about any DC bad guy whoever showed up in the panels is a candidate for Amanda Waller&#39;s Task Force X. In the comics, there aren&#39;t that many villains who haven&#39;t taken at least a turn or two in the Squad, and for quite a few their time in Task Force X was their last time&nbsp;anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to know everything that&#39;s surfaced about the second film, here&#39;s all the&nbsp;rumors and spoilers leaked so far about the sequel to&nbsp;Suicide Squad.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Gunn in different hands</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/suicide_squad_3.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /><br />\r\nJames Gunn &mdash; writer and director of Marvel Studios&#39; first two Guardians of the Galaxy&nbsp;films &mdash; was infamously&nbsp;booted from the director&#39;s chair of the upcoming (we hope)&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 in the wake of controversy regarding years-old tweets.

In October 2018, news dropped that Gunn was tapped to write the sequel to&nbsp;Suicide Squad. At the time the possibility of Gunn directing was raised but wasn&#39;t confirmed.

(via&nbsp;E!&nbsp;News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reynolds is known far and wide for two things: inhabiting the character of Deadpool to an extent which may not exactly be healthy, and his Twitter feed, which is one the greatest compendiums of hilarity on the entire internet. The latest sterling example of this was prompted by Twitter user @jediminndtrick, who asked: &quot;RYAN I HAVE AN IMPORTANT QUESTION I NEED AN ANSWER TO RIGHT TF NOW!!! My son is 4, he loves Marvel, I&#39;m dying to show him Deadpool but I can&#39;t decide if I should or not. Helpasistahout!!!!!!!!&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reynolds immediately leaped into action, doubtless convinced by all of those caps that this was, indeed, a question that needed to be answered with all due haste. His advice was as awesome as it was hilariously irresponsible: &quot;No,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Put on Spider-Man (from 2002) and tell him it&#39;s Deadpool. It&#39;s what I do with my kids. Remember to look him straight in the eye when you lie. Good luck.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, apparently, Reynolds&#39; children James (age 4) and Ines (age 2) think he is Spider-Man, which is a pretty neat trick if you ask us. Sure, there are a few similarities between the costumes of the wall-crawler and the Merc with a Mouth, but how on Earth does Reynolds explain why he looks exactly like Tobey Maguire when the mask comes off? We knew kids could be gullible, but that&#39;s just ridiculous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, a quick perusal of Reynolds&#39; previous tweets quickly reveal that his musings on parenting are never, ever, to be taken seriously. Here&#39;s a quick selection of our absolute favorites:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Tip: It&#39;s important parents take little &#39;time outs&#39; for themselves too. Even if you feel pretty guilty when you return 14 years later.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Love writing nursery rhymes for my daughter. Her favorites are, &#39;Sunshine-Cuddle-Time!&#39; and &#39;Everyone You Know Will Eventually Die.&#39;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;My daughter&#39;s only 6 months old and already drawing. I&#39;d hang it on the fridge but honestly, it&#39;s absolute garbage.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m teaching my daughter that the sun goes down each night because it&#39;s mad at her. Probably gonna write a book on parenting at some point.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, our all-time favorite: &quot;Totally caved and tossed my daughter the keys to the car. She looked really happy as they bounced off her tiny infant face.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously, Reynolds is a guy who loves his family and screwing with people in equal measure. Soon, he&#39;ll have another unsuspecting youngster to torment: he and his wife Blake Lively are expecting their third child any old time now. Little does the new arrival know that it&#39;s going to have Deadpool&hellip; er, Spider-Man&hellip; for a dad. Reynolds had better hope that his children never have occasion to meet Tobey Maguire, or they&#39;re going to have a lot of uncomfortable questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At any rate, the cinematic fate of Deadpool is still very much up in the air following Disney&#39;s acquisition of the film and television assets of Fox Studios. Although it&#39;s understandable that the character&#39;s R-rated antics might be a tough fit for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, 2016&#39;s&nbsp;Deadpool and 2018&#39;s&nbsp;Deadpool 2 combined to rake in over $1.5 billion dollars worldwide, and the House of Mouse is unlikely to put such a proven cash cow out to pasture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rumor mill insists that not only is&nbsp;Deadpool 3 in the works but that there are plans to weave the character into the fabric of the MCU by way of multiple cameos in Marvel Studios&#39; upcoming films and television series. Unfortunately, with talks between Marvel and Sony Pictures having recently broken down, it&#39;s looking increasingly likely that fans will never get to see the onscreen pairing that once seemed inevitable:&nbsp;Reynolds&#39; Deadpool and Tom Holland&#39;s Spider-Man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then again, from Reynolds&#39; point of view, this might be a good thing. When his kids get a little bit older, perhaps he can show them&nbsp;Spider-Man: Homecoming, breathlessly exclaiming, &quot;This one is about Deadpool when he was in high school! Didn&#39;t I look different back then?&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boy, are those kids ever going to grow up confused.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>How Deadpool changed movies and you barely noticed</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8081/Blog_Project/uploads/deadpool_2.jpg\" style=\"height:439px; width:780px\" /><br />\r\nDeadpool made quite a splash at the movies when it debuted in 2016. It brought all the essentials of a good superhero flick: meta-humor, B-list characters, minimalist action&hellip; okay, well, maybe its ingredients weren&#39;t the most orthodox when it comes to what we&#39;d expect from a movie starring a Marvel character. But ordinary or otherwise, this strange approach to superhero cinema definitely worked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One major reason for Deadpool&#39;s success was its R rating, which ensured bad words and copious amounts of violence would be on offer, but that&#39;s easy to spot. We&#39;re here to discuss the more esoteric reasons behind Deadpool&#39;s victory over low expectations &mdash; and, ultimately, superhero cinema as a whole. After all, this movie didn&#39;t just shake up the status quo for action-adventures starring guys in capes &mdash; it went the extra mile and set a lot of cinematic precedents, some of them quite subtly. Read on to see how Deadpool surreptitiously changed movies and you barely noticed.</p>\r\n', 2, 'Sep,16,2019 07:11:00 PM', 'Paige Turner.'),

While the director has shot down the possibility of an&nbsp;It:&nbsp;Chapter Three (since any such film would have to go to outside the story told by King&#39;s book), he told&nbsp;ET that he was &quot;not done&quot; with the story, saying that he plans to &quot;make this, like, special edition.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The filmmaker joked that &quot;the studio probably doesn&#39;t know this,&quot; before launching into his idea. &quot;We&#39;re in talks with the studio to make a supercut, which is basically the two movies edited together with all the material that is not in the released versions,&quot; he explained. &quot;And yeah, there are a couple of scenes that I want to shoot to make this a new experience, with things that people don&#39;t know was ever there.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked to elaborate on the new scenes he has in mind, Muschietti would only clarify that one of them will be lifted from King&#39;s novel, and the other will be original to the super-extended movie. &quot;I want to be a little cryptic about it,&quot; he laughed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He did, however, go on to say that in his estimation, the supercut would have a run time of right around six and a half hours. For those keeping score at home,&nbsp;It:&nbsp;Chapter One ran 2 hours and 5 minutes, while&nbsp;Chapter Two clocked in at 2 hours and 45 minutes. So, we&#39;re talking about 4 hours and 50 minutes of material that&#39;s already been presented in the two films&#39; theatrical releases, meaning that Muschietti intends to beef that up with around an hour and a half of deleted scenes and new footage. We&#39;d like to point out here that there are plenty of films that only run for about that length of time, so Muschietti is talking about making some pretty systemic changes to the material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The filmmaker even mused on the possibility that this supercut &mdash; which would test even the most formidable of bladders, were it to be screened in theaters &mdash; could perhaps find a home on a streaming service. &quot;People can choose how to see it, all in one or, you know, making little pauses,&quot; he said. &quot;Or binging! Maybe it&#39;s divided [into] episodes. People now, they binge a series for 10 hours of viewing, so it wouldn&#39;t surprise me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We know what you&#39;re thinking: why, this would be the perfect opportunity to restore the aesthetic of King&#39;s novel, which jumped back and forth between the two time periods in which the story takes place! At any rate, if you weren&#39;t thinking that before, you are now, because it&#39;s a pretty fantastic idea&hellip; but if Muschietti&#39;s previous comments about the potential supercut are any indication, this is decidedly not what he has in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just in case you&#39;re unaware, the two It&nbsp;movies&nbsp;follow a group of outcasts who dub themselves &quot;The Losers&#39; Club&quot; as they face off against the timeless, shape-shifting entity plaguing their small town of Derry, Maine. The evil being, which appears most often in the guise of Pennywise, the Dancing Clown (all the better to lure in children for Its meals), rises from its hibernation every 27 years &mdash; and when they fail to kill it as youngsters in 1989, they must return to Derry as adults to finish the job in 2017. While King&#39;s novel jumped back and forth between the two time periods (which were updated for the movies from 1958 and 1985),&nbsp;It:&nbsp;Chapter One tells the story of the young Losers&#39; Club, while&nbsp;It: Chapter Two focuses on the later time period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking to&nbsp;CinemaBlend last month, Muschietti indicated that he still intended to preserve the chronology of the two films, rather than attempting to mimic King&#39;s structure. &quot;I am thinking of a supercut, which is basically the two movies told one after the other, adding everything that was lifted from them for length purposes,&quot; the director explained. &quot;Great scenes that are more character moments, or things that we had to lift for other reasons. I&#39;m also very excited about shooting extra material.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, that&nbsp;still sounds pretty cool, and with a truckload of extra scenes, we would definitely be on board for the&nbsp;It supercut. There&#39;s even a precedent for Muschietti&#39;s idea of dividing the beast up into episodes: Quentin Tarantino&#39;s famously lengthy 2015 flick&nbsp;The Hateful Eight received that exact treatment when it was released to Netflix. The longest version of that film released to theaters ran for 3 hours and 7 minutes, while the repackaged &quot;miniseries&quot; version sports four episodes of about 50 minutes each. Both the episodic version and the theatrical cut are available for viewing on the streamer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s also worth mentioning that Warner Brothers, the parent company of&nbsp;It:&nbsp;Chapter One and&nbsp;It:&nbsp;Chapter Two studio New Line, has got its own streaming service on tap: HBO Max, which is expected to debut early next year and which would make the perfect home for&nbsp;It: Redux.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that Muschietti has talked about this project to two different media outlets within a couple of weeks is, to us, a pretty strong indication that he&#39;s not just yanking our chains about it. The director has previously said that he&#39;s keen to take a little break before jumping into his next big project:&nbsp;The Flash, the extremely long-awaited theatrical solo film for DC&#39;s Scarlet Speedster. Perhaps he&#39;ll use this downtime to assemble his ultimate cut of&nbsp;It; he hopes that this is the case, because the more we think about this supercut, the more we want it on our screens post-haste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It: Chapter Two is in theaters now.</p>\r\n', 2, 'Sep,16,2019 07:12:00 PM', 'Gail Forcewind.'),

Call it boredom, obsession, or a loving desire to more deeply understand the stories that we dig. Whatever causes this curiosity of human behavior, it can lead to some entertaining results. Case in point? That great punching bag of misunderstood billion-dollar blockbusters, the Matrix trilogy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At its core, the Matrix franchise is built on the two things that every conspiracy theorist loves: a stalwart belief that the world is a lie&nbsp;and very shaky details. Maybe that&#39;s why 20 years on, it remains one of the world&#39;s most prominent hubs for pop culture fan theory enthusiasm. After more than two decades, people are still analyzing every frame and perceived undertone and friends? Things get bonkers. Get ready to question your reality&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;or at the very least, whether there was a deeper meaning to those chocolate chip cookies all along &mdash; as we look at the Matrix theories that would change everything.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>It&#39;s all real, and you&#39;re falling for it</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"uploads/matrix_2.jpg\" style=\"height:438px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As regular internet users know, there&#39;s a happy contingent of moviegoers in the world who take a great deal of personal pride in being able to poke holes in a film&#39;s plot using an arsenal of boring, complicated tools like &quot;science&quot; and &quot;reality.&quot; These are the folks who spend their days picking apart the minutiae of a flick, pointing and going, &quot;That&#39;s dumb.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of their favorite targets is the Matrix franchise&#39;s claim that humans are being used to generate bioelectric power for the Machines. The nerd community was quick to point out that this was inefficient, since a person&#39;s body would, by necessity, consume more power than it could ever put out. It&#39;d be a little bit like trying to run a battery charger on the batteries it was charging.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what if we told you that all of that was a lie? What if humans actually do produce the energy necessary to juice up a robot army and the world&#39;s most malevolent Second Life server? It sounds crazy, but there&#39;s a solid explanation for why we wouldn&#39;t know about it. According to one theory on Reddit, we&#39;re all living in the Matrix right this second, and our robot overlords have programmed the simulation to make it seem like we generate less power than we actually do. The purpose? Plausible deniability, and an easy way to throw us off the scent, keeping us from ever taking the all-too-real Matrix stories too seriously.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Agent Smith is the One</h1>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"uploads/matrix_3.jpg\" style=\"height:438px; width:780px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a long-running fan theory, Neo was never the One at all. Sound crazy? Then think about the parameters that Morpheus lays out for his cyberpunk messiah. He says that the One was born inside the Matrix, has the ability to change the Matrix&#39;s code, and would eventually destroy the system. While that might sound like Neo at first glance, putting a little bit of thought into it puts some dents in the description.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neo wasn&#39;t technically born in the Matrix. Instead, he was born in a goo pod and then jacked in. He can do some wild stuff while he&#39;s on the inside, but we never really see him change the Matrix itself, just the things he can do when he&#39;s plugged up. And as far as destroying the Matrix goes, he definitely chipped in, but can we really say that he was 100 percent responsible for shutting everything down? Obviously, the descriptions of the One don&#39;t fit Neo like a glove. Not the way they do Agent Smith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Born in the Matrix? Check. Able to change its code? That&#39;s all the guy does in movies two and three. And even before he gets reintegrated with the Source at the end of Revolutions, Smith has caused more damage to the overall program than a baby boomer opening every email in their spam folder.</p>\r\n', 2, 'Sep,16,2019 07:13:00 PM', 'Gail Forcewind.'),

It was a bit of a risky prospect to bring the Pok&eacute;mon franchise into the world of live-action, but thanks to excellent CGI work, deft direction from Rob Letterman, and a spot-on voice turn from the always dependable Ryan Reynolds, the flick worked marvelously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also made a freaking ton of money, so of course,&nbsp;Detective Pikachu 2 was all but inevitable.&nbsp;It&#39;s been reported that studio Legendary is currently kicking around ideas for an entire slate of live-action Pok&eacute;mon flicks, and it&#39;s likely that many &mdash; if not all &mdash; of these will be centered on characters we were introduced to in&nbsp;Detective Pikachu. But before Legendary goes nuts with the spin-offs, the studio will follow up on its proven property with Detective Pikachu 2&nbsp;&mdash; despite the fact that&nbsp;Detective Pikachu didn&#39;t exactly leave the door wide open for a direct sequel and left us with many questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will Reynolds and co-star Justice Smith, who played Pikachu&#39;s partner and former Pok&eacute;mon trainer, Tim Goodman, return for the second film?

As the production of&nbsp;Detective Pikachu progressed, however, the company&#39;s brass liked what they saw. And after the flick scored over $430 million dollars at the worldwide box office, Legendary essentially got the green light to move full speed ahead on the &quot;Pok&eacute;verse,&quot; as we&#39;re going to call it until someone tells us to stop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s been rumored&nbsp;that Legendary is developing a spin-off focused on Mewtwo and that the studio is also kicking around the idea of adapting the storylines of the iconic video games&nbsp;Pokemon Red and&nbsp;Pokemon Blue for the big screen. But&nbsp;Detective Pikachu 2 is the priority, so at the very least, we know that we&#39;ll be seeing the sequel&nbsp;before any spin-offs come to fruition. When might that be? Well, between announcement and release, it took Detective Pikachu about three years to reach screens. However, with writer Oren Uziel (Men in Black: International) already hard at work&nbsp;on the sequel,&nbsp;we&#39;re going to optimistically guess that we could see&nbsp;Detective Pikachu 2 in late 2021 or early 2022.</p>\r\n', 2, 'Sep,16,2019 07:14:00 PM', 'Paige Turner.');

(via&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jackson was the stunt double for star Milla Jovovich on the film, and a complaint filed on her behalf described how she was pressed into shooting a hurriedly conceived sequence in dangerous conditions that left her in a medically-induced coma after a camera rig collided with her upper body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;On September 5, 2015, Plaintiff suffered a horrific on-set injury, which was a by-product of Defendants&#39; practice of elevating financial considerations over safety,&quot; the complaint reads. &quot;Plaintiff was originally slated to shoot a fight scene that day. However, in a last-minute change, she was asked to perform a dangerous and technically complex motorcycle scene in adverse weather conditions. The scene involved a vehicle fitted with a mechanical crane attached to a camera driving toward Plaintiff, as she sped on her motorcycle directly at the camera. The camera was supposed to elevate safely above Plaintiff&#39;s head before she reached it. But the haphazardly planned stunt went terribly wrong.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That, dear reader, is putting it mildly. If you&#39;re the squeamish type, you may want to skip over this next paragraph, because to paraphrase the great Roger Ebert, it will make you scream. The complaint continues, &quot;The crane operator failed to raise the camera in time, and as a result, the camera smashed into Plaintiff, slicing through the bone of her forearm and tearing the flesh off her cheek, leaving her teeth exposed. The blow was so forceful that it twisted the Plaintiff&#39;s shoulder blade backward, ripping-out five nerves connected into her spinal column at the root. Among other catastrophic injuries, which are too numerous to even summarize here, Plaintiff&#39;s left arm had to be amputated and cerebral spinal fluid seeped from an opening created by the nerves tearing from her spinal column.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jackson was placed in to a coma so that doctors could perform the surgery that saved her life &mdash; but during her medical ordeal, the suit claims that things went from bad to worse. It alleges that producers had failed to secure a sufficient level of insurance for such a stunt-heavy production, and that as a result, only $33,000 dollars was paid out to cover Jackson&#39;s injuries. For the benefit of those who have never seen the inside of a hospital or do not live in the U.S., this is an amount that barely scratched the surface of the costs incurred by Jackson to treat her injuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The suit went on to allege that prior to her hiring, the flick&#39;s producers had knowingly concealed from Jackson the fact that they&#39;d skimped mightily on insurance coverage, knowing full well that if the in-demand stunt performer had had any idea what she was walking into, she would have passed on the job in a heartbeat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Plaintiff was lukewarm on performing in The Final Chapter, to begin with,&quot; the complaint asserted. &quot;She had already secured the role of a stunt double for a leading cast member in [the 2017 feature]&nbsp;Wonder Woman and didn&#39;t need the work. Defendants knew Plaintiff was hesitant to accept the role but had an urgent need for a replacement stunt performer. They concealed from Plaintiff the true nature of the woefully deficient insurance coverage, which they knew would be a deal-breaker for her.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of all that, the complaint alleges that while Jackson was in a coma, producers assured her husband that they would be covering all of her medical costs, saying that he &quot;should not be worrying about that.&quot; As it turned out, he should absolutely have been worrying about that, for it&#39;s alleged that when the bill arrived for Jackson&#39;s care, the movie&#39;s producers simply bailed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;After skimping on insurance and causing Plaintiff&#39;s nightmarish injuries, Defendants shamelessly abandoned Plaintiff and welched on their promise to provide financial support to cover her medical expenses,&quot; the complaint concluded. &quot;Plaintiff was left without the financial means to cover the medical care she desperately needed for her grievous injuries, while Defendants, for their part, continue to enjoy the abundant profits generated by The Final Chapter.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a grim aside, Jackson&#39;s complaint noted that while she&#39;ll never be able to work in her chosen profession again as the result of negligence on the set of&nbsp;Resident Evil:&nbsp;The Final Chapter, she still got off easy compared to crew member Ricardo Cornelius. On December 3, 2015, Cornelius was crushed when a Humvee slid off of the rotating platform on which it was parked and pinned him against a wall. Cornelius was rushed to the hospital, but died; the incident wasn&#39;t reported until a few weeks later after The Final Chapter&nbsp;had completed production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Named in the lawsuit are Bolt Pictures and producer Jeremy Bolt, production company Tannhauser Gate, and the flick&#39;s director Paul W.S. Anderson. Jackson is seeking unspecified damages, and it&#39;s worth mentioning that the incident cut short a promising career. Although she&#39;d only been in the business for five years at the time of her injury, she&#39;d already doubled for Karen Gillan&nbsp;in&nbsp;Guardians of the Galaxy,&nbsp;Elizabeth Olsen in&nbsp;Avengers:&nbsp;Age of Ultron, and Charlize Theron in&nbsp;Mad Max: Fury Road, among other credits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&#39;ll keep an eye out for developments in this shocking and sad story, and we&#39;ll keep you up to speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 3, 'Sep,16,2019 07:15:00 PM', 'Paige Turner.'),

And given the stage play&#39;s success, it&#39;s not out of the realm of reality that Warner Bros. would want to make big bucks with a feature film adaptation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, we can puncture quite a few holes in this rumor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, this isn&#39;t the first time we&#39;ve heard reports that Warner Bros. wants to turn&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&nbsp;into a film. In August 2016, just two months after The Cursed Child began its London previews,&nbsp;New York Daily News ran an article claiming that Warner Bros. was interested in adapting the play for the silver screen in a project that would debut &quot;as soon as 2020.&quot; The studio is said to have hoped at least Radcliffe would board the film to reprise his most famous role. According to the outlet&#39;s sources, however, Radcliffe &quot;made it clear that his mind is certainly not focused on returning to the role anytime soon &hellip;&nbsp;He doesn&#39;t need to go back for money or to reboot his career, so he will need some persuading.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This report started a hot fire of speculation that began burning up social media. In September 2016, Warner Bros. representatives issued a statement debunking the rumor: &quot;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a stage play, with no plans for there to be a film.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That didn&#39;t stop fans from believing the exact opposite, though.&nbsp;When the rumor again took on a life of its own, Rowling herself shot it down, stating in a January 2017 tweet that it was all a lie: &quot;I know a lot of people are looking for reasons to be cheerful today, but there is NO TRUTH to the rumor about a #CursedChild movie trilogy!&quot;&nbsp;While this could suggest that if a trilogy won&#39;t happen, perhaps one or two movies will, it seems to make that assumption would be bending Rowling&#39;s words to fit a different meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, there&#39;s the issue of whether Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint would genuinely want to come back to the franchise.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a 2018 interview with The Guardian, Grint said that he deeply enjoyed his time playing Ron Weasley, but found it difficult to return to normal life when the film series wrapped in 2011.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I don&#39;t want to liken it to coming out of prison because it wasn&#39;t a prison, but it did feel like stepping out of an institution,&quot; the actor shared, adding that he often considered leaving the franchise between films, as the experience became &quot;so all-consuming&quot; at times. That doesn&#39;t exactly inspire a lot of confidence in the idea that Grint would be down to come back to the&nbsp;Harry Potter universe for another movie, does it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For his part, Radcliffe has said that he&#39;s not really interested in reprising his role as Harry Potter &mdash; though other people were certainly still having that conversation with him at the time. He told&nbsp;E! News&nbsp;in 2018, &quot;To a certain extent with things like the play and [the&nbsp;Harry Potter spin-off franchise]&nbsp;Fantastic Beasts, I think people are still interested in talking to me about it, but nothing&#39;s been happening in that area. At the moment, I&#39;m very much enjoying playing lots of different stuff.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Radcliffe also told&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter in 2016 that he would be a-okay with another actor playing Harry Potter, should Warner Bros. ever want to reboot the franchise. &quot;It&#39;ll be interesting if they reboot them and just do the films again or do a series; I&#39;m fascinated to watch &hellip;&nbsp;but I think I&#39;ll be happy enough and secure enough to let someone else play it,&quot; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In November 2018, Radcliffe admitted that he had no intention of ever watching&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.&nbsp;The actor explained during his appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers (via Entertainment Weekly) that it wouldn&#39;t be &quot;a relaxing evening at the theater,&quot; and he would feel like he was being monitored by fans for his reaction. &quot;Maybe that is completely conceited and egotistical and people wouldn&#39;t care, but I do feel if I was just surrounded by Harry Potter fans, it would be a little odd,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those comments pose an important question:&nbsp;If Radcliffe doesn&#39;t ever want to see the play, why would he want to be in a film adaptation of it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unsurprisingly,&nbsp;Watson has taken a similar stance as her&nbsp;Potter co-stars on the matter: she&#39;s fine not reprising the role that made her a household name. Asked by&nbsp;then-Entertainment Weekly senior staff writer Anthony Breznican during a SiriusXM interview if she would ever return to the wizarding world, Watson answered, &quot;Ask me in another 10 years.&quot; She also stated that&nbsp;Breznican was simply &quot;causing carnage&quot; by asking her that question.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It sure seems like the trio are perfectly content with their lives post-Potter, but there is one thing that could have persuaded them to sign on for the rumored&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child movie: money &mdash; and lots of it. Since Warner Bros. suffered disappointment with the less-than-fantastic performance of&nbsp;Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,&nbsp;the 2018 sequel to&nbsp;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,&nbsp;it&#39;s possible that the studio is looking to get its&nbsp;Potter-verse back on track&nbsp;by finally going through with&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child &mdash; and was willing to spend whatever money it took to convince Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson to join the film, knowing that their involvement would send audiences to theaters in droves and make it effortless to recoup any and all costs incurred.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the three stars have done well for themselves outside the&nbsp;Potter franchise &mdash; with Radcliffe impressing in indie flicks like&nbsp;Swiss Army Man and on the Broadway stage, Grint popping up on the big and small screens in various different projects, and Watson joining the Disney family as Belle in 2017&#39;s live-action&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast &mdash; none have reached the same level of success they attained during their time as witches and wizards. With what might have been major money on the table and the promise of even more success, perhaps Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson really did accept the offer to star in&nbsp;Harry Potter and the Cursed Child&hellip; if an offer even happened, that is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With nostalgia becoming an increasingly common marketing tactic &mdash; and, in many cases, the sole reason to greenlight a project &mdash; it&#39;s understandable why Warner Bros. might want to make this ambitious project a reality. Still, with nothing confirmed and with&nbsp;Cursed Child representatives in New York reportedly indicating on September 5 that &quot;there are no plans whatsoever for a movie,&quot; the whole thing is up in the air.&nbsp;When and if Warner Bros. says &quot;Accio&nbsp;Cursed Child&quot; and makes the film happen, rest assured that we&#39;ll fill you in with all the details.&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 3, 'Sep,16,2019 07:17:00 PM', 'Bob Frapples.');
